    <h1 style="text-align: center">Blockchain Technology for Loans</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Overview of the Project</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">The project idea that I had in mind involves using blockchain technology to speed up and reduce cost when applying for a loan from a broker and any other party within this process. It will use smart contracts to record information on the blockchain and will no longer need to be recorded in paper form which will reduce the time it takes from one party to another.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">How would this project be useful</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">The process of purchasing a home may be daunting with many variables needing to be dealt with such as obtaining a mortgage and a loan, this process also involves many hours talking to many individuals such as bankers and brokers and signing important documents that are usually in paper form. Any mishaps in this process may cause the potential home buyer to have to redo everything due to a small mistake that could have been avoided with a block chain system. </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Key features of the project</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">This program will be run on a smart contract, a smart contract is a program which executes when certain predetermined conditions are met. When applying for a mortgage there are many documents that are required to approve for a loan, to first apply for a loan a broker must seek out information such as credit ratings, income, and asset details. when all the required information is gathered, a smart contract will be executed which will record all relevant information onto the blockchain and will be sent to the next designated character within the process which will be a banker who will verify the information such as their credit rating. All the information that is acquired by the broker would usually be recorded on paper and as such brokers may misplace the information which would result in the client having to redo the whole process. Additionally, as the information is in paper form it would take days for the broker to send the relevant information to the bank and this is where a blockchain system can solve this issue. A blockchain is a system that stores various types of data which is immutable and is transparent to all users, this would be helpful to all users within this scenario as the information recorded would be unable to be changed and can be viewed instantly by any party removing the days needed to transfer information from one party to another. Furthermore, the information recorded in the blockchain would be on a digital interface making it more efficient for parties to check out the data.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Tools and Technology required for the project</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">Solidity is a programming software which allows people to create smart contracts, Smart contracts are programs on the blockchain that initiate when certain predetermined conditions are met. Atom would also be required to make a marketplace/website for the smart contract to be held and allow individuals such as the client, broker and lender to use the project and see all relevant information at all times.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Skills required for the project</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: center">
      <li>One must know how to code a smart contract which automatically execute an action when the predetermined conditions are met.</li>
      <li>You should also need to understand algorithms and data structure.</li>
      <li>You should know how to write secure code to protect your smart contracts from any unwanted attacks.</li>
      <li>You should also know a coding language to make a website for the project to be on. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Outcome</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">If the project is successful, then the process of obtaining a loan to buy homes and any other good that requires a loan such as cars will be more efficient as it takes out the processing time of sending and receiving important information from all parties within the process. It will make it overall easier and faster to obtain a loan for everyone.  </p>
