    <h2 style="text-align: center">How would this project be useful</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">The process of purchasing a home may be daunting with many variables needing to be dealt with such as obtaining a mortgage and a loan, this process also involves many hours talking to many individuals such as bankers and brokers and signing important documents that are usually in paper form. Any mishaps in this process may cause the potential home buyer to have to redo everything due to a small mistake that could have been avoided with a block chain system. </p>
