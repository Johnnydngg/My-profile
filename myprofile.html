    <h2 style="text-align: center">Personal Information</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Hello! My name is Johnny Dang, and my nationality is Vietnamese and as such you would think that I would speak Vietnamese at home however! My Vietnamese isn’t very good because I stopped going to Vietnamese school when I was in year 7 and due to this I speak to my parents in broken Vietnamese and partially in English. As being Vietnamese and being in the Vietnamese culture, we learn that to express gratitude to the people around you, you must constantly be around them, and this has been imprinted into me at a very young age through family and friends’ gatherings every weekend. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center">I graduated Highschool back in 2019 with a found passion of Economics and finance, I found it fascinating how people could make money through buying and selling stock but also build foundation for their future through investing into ETF also known as exchange traded funds. Due to this passion, I applied for the bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance to better help myself understand how these investors and traders act and behave when determining what to buy and sell within the market with different market conditions. As of current times I am still interested in how traders buy and sell stocks however, with the new craze of Cryptocurrencies taking over the world, this has been my new focus to understand how the blockchain works and investing into micro-capped cryptocurrencies.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center">An obvious fact about me that you could have determined while reading this is that I like to analyse the market to figure out where the market is heading, this includes reading the news such as upcoming cpi figures and analysing charts through tools such as Macd and RSI. Another fun fact is that during my past times I like to read Manhwas, these are basically Korean comics. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Interest in IT!</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">My interest in IT began when the 2021 cryptocurrency craze began, and I was beginning to research and learn about what the blockchain was. What I found interesting about the blockchain was how it worked; it uses hash linking which leaves a digital footprint that cannot be changed when verified on the blockchain, this solves the double spending issue that came about when the blockchain was first introduced. I also found interesting how information on the blockchain is immutable and transparent which implies that information that is recorded on the blockchain cannot be changed when it is verified on the blockchain, and anyone can view the information from the start to the current. Other than that, I do not have any other prior IT experience as I have not done any IT subjects back in high school nor in university. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">As stated previously I came to RMIT for Economics and Finance, to learn about traditional financial system and learning how to trade and the mindset of investors. However, now I am more interested in the blockchain and how it works. From this subject I would like to learn more about the blockchain if provided but also how to code and make websites/webpages.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>The ideal job that I would want after many years working in the finance sector would be a senior investment analyst. An investment analyst is appealing to me as I’m interested finding ways to get big returns on my investment, such as with stocks and with cryptocurrencies, I would believe that I would enjoy doing research and reports on these investment assets to increase returns for traders and companies. </p>
    <p>The skills required for this job consist of being able to do market research on the economy and being able to find niche assets that would provide a profitable return for your clients. You would also need to be able to prepare detailed reports on these assets to persuade your clients why these assets would be beneficial to invest into and showcase technical analysis on these assets such as RSI, Macd and moving averages. Furthermore, this job would require you to have 3+ years of experience within this sector, this would showcase that you have experience with providing detailed reports and maintaining good relationships with your clients. </p>
    <p>As I’m currently studying economics and finance, I have developed skills that would allow me a chance to get this job. The skills that I have acquired during my time are:</p>
    <ul style="text-align: center">
      <li>	Being able to do market research and create detailed reports of my findings</li>

      <li>	Being able to prioritise tasks and finishing them within a time limit</li>
      <li>	Maintaining and improving relationships with existing and new clients</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be qualified for this position I would need to have many years within this sector.
