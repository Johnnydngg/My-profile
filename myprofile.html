    <h2 style="text-align: center">Personal Information</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Hello! My name is Johnny Dang, and my nationality is Vietnamese and as such you would think that I would speak Vietnamese at home however! My Vietnamese isn’t very good because I stopped going to Vietnamese school when I was in year 7 and due to this I speak to my parents in broken Vietnamese and partially in English. As being Vietnamese and being in the Vietnamese culture, we learn that to express gratitude to the people around you, you must constantly be around them, and this has been imprinted into me at a very young age through family and friends’ gatherings every weekend. </p>
    <p style="text-align: center">I graduated Highschool back in 2019 with a found passion of Economics and finance, I found it fascinating how people could make money through buying and selling stock but also build foundation for their future through investing into ETF also known as exchange traded funds. Due to this passion, I applied for the bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance to better help myself understand how these investors and traders act and behave when determining what to buy and sell within the market with different market conditions. As of current times I am still interested in how traders buy and sell stocks however, with the new craze of Cryptocurrencies taking over the world, this has been my new focus to understand how the blockchain works and investing into micro-capped cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">An obvious fact about me that you could have determined while reading this is that I like to analyse the market to figure out where the market is heading, this includes reading the news such as upcoming cpi figures and analysing charts through tools such as Macd and RSI. Another fun fact is that during my past times I like to read Manhwas, these are basically Korean comics. </p>
