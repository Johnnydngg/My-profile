    <h1 style="text-align: center">Personality Test</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Myers-briggs</h2>
    <p>Online personality and learning tests can provide a subtle outlook on how someone works in a team but also how they are as a person which can help businesses pick out potential employees who fit their description. The results from the Myers-Briggs personality test indicated that I had a campaigner personality, I would agree with this test as I’m someone who is curious and isn’t afraid to go out of my safe zone, I am also a festive person which means that I enjoy having deep and meaningful conversations with people. I also fit the weaknesses of a person who has a campaigner personality as I’m a people pleaser which means that I constantly care about how other people think about me and how I can please them, I’m also someone who is overly optimistic which makes it difficult for me to accept hard but necessary truths. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Education Planner and Auditory Test</h2>
    <p>The second test that I took was a learning test from education planner, it indicated to me that I’m an auditory learner. This meant that I’m someone who learns from hearing and listening which I can agree with as I find it easier to learn by listening. The Last test that I took was another personality test by PsychCentral which indicated that I was someone who enjoyed lively centre of attention, this outlined that people see me as someone whose fresh, lively, charming amusing and always interesting which I hope people do see me as these things.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">Overview of these Test</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">These outcomes have indicated to me that I’m someone who enjoys working in a team and my behaviour about working in a team has not changed after seeing these results as I’m someone who puts in their best when other people are reliant on me. When scouting out potential teammates I need to find people who are similar to me, this comprises of people who enjoy working in a team and strives to do their best and not to disappoint their teammates. </p>
